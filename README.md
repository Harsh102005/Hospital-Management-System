# Hospital-Management-System
This Hospital Management System in C serves as a basic prototype for managing patient records and billing. It demonstrates important programming concepts such as file handling, structure usage, date/time functions, and console-based UI. The system is extendable and can be enhanced further by integrating a GUI, database, or more complex medical modules.

The system allows the hospital staff to:
1)Enter new patient details.
2)Add treatment items with quantity, price, and timestamp.
3)Generate an invoice with GST and discounts.
4)Save the invoice to a file.
5)View all previous invoices.
6)Search invoices by patient name.
